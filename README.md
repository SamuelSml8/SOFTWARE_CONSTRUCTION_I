## Workshop exercises deliverable 1 | 15%

### 1. Triangle Classification

Prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Then, determine whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene using conditional structures.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Triangle.java)

### 2. Leap Year

Determines whether a year entered by the user is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Leap_year.java)

### 3. Three Number Ordering

Prompts the user to enter three numbers and then prints them in ascending order using conditional structures.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Number_ordering.java)

### 4. Discount Calculator

Calculates the final price of a product after applying a discount. The user must enter the original price and the discount percentage.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Discount_calculator.java)

### 5. Multiplication Table (No Loops)

Prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user, from 1 to 10, without using loops.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Multiplication_table.java)

### 6. Average Calculation

Prompts the user to enter three grades, stores them in variables, calculates the average and prints it on the screen.
   - [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-1/src/workshop_1/Average.java)
