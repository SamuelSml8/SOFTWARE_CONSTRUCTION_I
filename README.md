## Workshop exercises deliverable 2 | 15%

### 1. Calculation of grade point average

Write a JAVA program that prompts the user to enter a number n of ratings. Then, the program should prompt the user to enter each grade and store them in a vector. Once all the grades have been entered, the program should calculate and display the average of the grades. In addition, the program should indicate whether the student passed or failed, considering that a pass is passed with an average equal to or greater than 60.

### 2. Task list management

Develop a Java program to manage a list of tasks. The program should allow the user to perform the following operations:

### 3. Ordering of odd and even numbers in separate lists

Write a JAVA program that prompts the user to enter a number n of integers. Then, the program should prompt the user to enter each number and store them in a vector. Once all the numbers have been entered, the program should separate the odd and even numbers into two different lists and display both lists.
- [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-2/src/workshop_2/OrderingNumbers.java)

### 4. Addition of matrices

Develop a JAVA program that allows the user to enter two two-dimensional matrices of size n x m. The program must sum both matrices and display the result in a new matrix. If the matrices do not have the same dimensions, the program should display an error message.
- [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-2/src/workshop_2/MatrixAddition.java)

### 5. Calculation of the factorial of a number

Develop a program in C# that prompts the user to enter a positive integer n. The program should calculate and display the factorial of n.
- [Code](https://github.com/SamuelSml8/SOFTWARE_CONSTRUCTION_I/blob/ws-2/src/workshop_2/FactorialNumber.java)

### 6. Caesar Cipher

Implement a program in JAVA that allows to encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher. The program should prompt the user to enter a message and a k offset value. Then it must encrypt the message by moving each letter k positions to the right in the alphabet.
